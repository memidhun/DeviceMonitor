# DeviceMonitor

DeviceMonitor is a simple yet powerful C# Windows Forms Application designed to simulate and monitor sensor data in real time.  
It showcases basic principles of desktop application development, sensor data simulation, and user interface design using C# and .NET Framework.

## ✨ Features

- 📈 Real-time simulated sensor readings
- 🔄 Periodic automatic updates
- 🛠️ Simple, intuitive Windows Forms UI
- 🧹 Clean, modular code structure
- 📦 Easy to extend for real hardware sensor integration

## 📂 Project Structure
- **DeviceMonitor.sln**: Solution file for Visual Studio.
- **README.md**: This file you are reading.
- **LICENSE**: License for the project (optional, but recommended).
- **DeviceMonitor/**: Main project folder containing code files:
  - **Program.cs**: Entry point for the application.
  - **Form1.cs**: Main logic and event handlers.
  - **Form1.Designer.cs**: UI design (Windows Forms).
  - **SensorSimulator.cs**: Random sensor data generation.
  - **Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs**: Metadata for the project.
---

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **SensorSimulator.cs** generates random sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity, distance).
- **Form1.cs** updates the UI with fresh sensor readings at regular intervals.
- Users can view live updates inside the application window.
- Architecture designed to easily plug in real hardware later if needed.
